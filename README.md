## Gameplay
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
The snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head.
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.
A sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult.
